## Overview of the analysis

### Purpose

- The purpose of this project is to visualize the ride-sharing data by city type using Pandas. The programme helps make a multi-line graph to show the trends of total fare in urban, suburban, as well as rural cities, from January to April of 2019.

## Results

- In terms of total rides, rural cities have 125 rides; suburban cities have 625 rides; and urban cities have 1625 rides. Urban cities clearly have the largest total rides, with 1000 more than suburban cities. Suburban cities come in second place, and rural cities have the fewest rides.
- In terms of total drivers, there are 78 drives total in rural cities, 490 in suburban cities, and 2405 in urban cities. Once again, urban cities take the lead on the amount of drivers they have, with almost five times as many as the amount of suburban drivers. Suburban cities come in second place, and rural cities have the fewest drivers.
- In terms of total fares, the total fares of rural cities is $4327.93; total fares of suburban cities is $19,356.33; total fares of urban cities is $39,854.38. Total fares in urban cities is the largest, followed by suburban cities, followed by rural cities. 
- In terms of average fare per ride, it costs $34.62 per ride in rural cities, $30.97 per ride in suburban cities, and $24.53 per ride in urban cities. Urban cities have the cheapest rate, followed by suburban cities, followed by rural cities. 
- In terms of average fare per driver, average fare per driver in rural cities is $55.49; average fare per driver in suburban cities is $39.50; average fare per driver in urban cities is only $16.57. Drivers in rural cities get paid way more than drivers in suburban cities or urban cities.
- In terms of total fare by city type, the following multi-line graph shows the trend from January to April of 2019. The total fare
